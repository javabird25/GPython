Addon creation tutorial: part 2
===============================

*See the* :doc:`Part 1 <tutorial1>` *if you haven't seen it yet.*

In this tutorial we will improve our "Hello, World" addon a bit.

We will print the "Hello, X!" text to the player's chat instead of the game console, and there will be the player's
nickname in place of "X".

First, rename the ``__shared_autorun__`` folder to ``__client_autorun__``, because we don't need the server to
participate in the "Hello world" printing process.

Then, open the ``__init__.py`` script again.

We have to make two changes here: first, we need to print the text to the chat instead of the game console.
There is the :func:`gmod.chat.print` function which prints text to the chat.

To use it, we have to import ``chat module`` from ``gmod`` package. Add this code to the top of the file::

    from gmod import chat

Then, replace the ``print`` function call with the ``chat.print``::

    from gmod import chat

    chat.print('Hello world!')

Now ``Hello world!`` will be printed to the chat. Let's make this greeting personal now: we will greet the player
instead of the world.

We can get the client's player by calling the function :func:`gmod.player.getlocal`. Let's import the
:mod:`~gmod.player` module and create a variable ``ply`` and store the local player here::

    from gmod import chat, player

    ply = player.getlocal()
    chat.print('Hello world!')

:class:`~gmod.player.Player` has the ``nick`` property which can be used to get the player's nick. So we replace "world"
with the player's nick in out greeting::

    from gmod import chat, player

    ply = player.getlocal()
    chat.print('Hello', ply.nick, '!')

We're done. Save and close the script, launch
