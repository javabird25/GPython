Python console in Garry's Mod
=============================

You can access the Python interpreter from inside of Garry's Mod. Just use the ``python`` console command:

.. image:: images/repl.png

Everything from :mod:`pygmod.gmodapi` will be imported automatically.

.. note:: At the moment, only the client realm can be worked with. Support for the server realm will be added later.
